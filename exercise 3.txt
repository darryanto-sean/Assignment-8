a)
No change in the javascript file

b) 
In HTML5, buttons became prevalent and more diverse/shorter than 
<input type="button"...> with the <button> tag. As I have read: 
"Button tags offer richer rendering possibilities: the BUTTON element may have content. For example, 
a BUTTON element that contains an image functions like and may resemble 
an INPUT element whose type is set to “image”. 
You can use the <button> element for buttons with various actions 
or submit a form, however, YOU SHOULD NOT use the input element outside a 
form or for other action than submit/validate a form.
